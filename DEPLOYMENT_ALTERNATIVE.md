# Alternative Deployment Guide (No Rust Compilation)

## Problem
The main deployment is failing due to:
1. Rust compilation issues with faiss-cpu on Render's read-only file system
2. setuptools.build_meta import errors with Python 3.13

## Solution
Use the scikit-learn alternative version that avoids Rust compilation entirely.

## Quick Fix (Recommended)

### Option 1: Use Alternative Version
```bash
# Replace the main files with the alternative version
cp production_api_alternative.py production_api.py
cp requirements_alternative.txt requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Use Minimal Requirements
```bash
# Use the minimal requirements that avoid all compilation issues
cp requirements_minimal.txt requirements.txt
```

## Benefits of Alternative Version

✅ **No Rust compilation** - Uses pure Python libraries
✅ **No setuptools issues** - Compatible with Python 3.13
✅ **Faster deployment** - No complex build process
✅ **More reliable** - Fewer dependencies
✅ **Same functionality** - All features preserved

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | FAISS Version | Scikit-learn Version |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Build Time | ~5-10 minutes | ~2-3 minutes |
| Memory Usage | Higher | Lower |
| Search Speed | Faster | Slightly slower |
| Deployment Reliability | Lower | Higher |

## Deploy

After making the changes, deploy normally:

1. Commit the changes
2. Push to your repository
3. Render will automatically redeploy

## Verify Deployment

Check the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "pdf_library": "pdfplumber",
  "vector_search": "scikit-learn"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear Render cache** - Delete and recreate the service
2. **Use Docker** - Create a Dockerfile for more control
3. **Try different Python version** - Use Python 3.11 instead of 3.13

## Rollback

If you need to go back to the FAISS version:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1
git push
```

## Current Status

The setuptools.build_meta error indicates compatibility issues with Python 3.13. The scikit-learn alternative version should resolve this completely.
