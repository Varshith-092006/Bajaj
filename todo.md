## LLM Document Processing System Optimization

### Phase 1: Analyze existing system and documents
- [x] Unzip project and install dependencies
- [x] Review `main.py` for core logic and identify areas for improvement
- [ ] Understand the document structure and content of the provided PDFs

### Phase 2: Extract and analyze PDF documents
- [ ] Implement robust PDF text extraction, handling tables and images
- [ ] Pre-process extracted text for better quality (e.g., cleaning, normalization)
- [ ] Analyze document content to identify key sections and entities

### Phase 3: Optimize system architecture and performance
- [x] Evaluate alternative embedding models for efficiency and accuracy
- [x] Optimize FAISS index for faster retrieval
- [x] Implement caching mechanisms for embeddings and LLM responses
- [x] Explore asynchronous processing for concurrent operations

### Phase 4: Enhance accuracy with better document processing
- [x] Improve chunking strategy to preserve semantic meaning
- [x] Implement query expansion or re-ranking for retrieval
- [x] Fine-tune LLM prompt for better decision-making and justification

### Phase 5: Implement deployment optimizations
- [x] Containerize the application using Docker
- [x] Optimize Docker image size
- [x] Configure Gunicorn/Uvicorn for production deployment
- [x] Implement health checks and logging

### Phase 6: Test and validate the optimized system
- [x] Develop comprehensive test cases based on sample queries
- [x] Evaluate performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- [x] Assess accuracy of decisions and justifications

### Phase 7: Deploy the optimized system
- [x] Deploy the containerized application to a cloud platform
- [x] Monitor deployed system for performance and errors

### Phase 8: Deliver results to user
- [x] Provide a summary of optimizations and improvements
- [x] Deliver access to the deployed system and source code
