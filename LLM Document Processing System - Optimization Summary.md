```json
{
  "decision": "conditional",
  "answer": "Knee surgery is covered under the policy with a waiting period of 2 years for pre-existing conditions",
  "amount": "Up to â‚¹5,00,000",
  "clause_reference": "Section 4.2, Page 15",
  "justification": "The policy covers surgical procedures but requires completion of waiting period for pre-existing conditions",
  "confidence": "high",
  "processing_time": 2.3
}
```
